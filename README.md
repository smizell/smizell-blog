# Stephen Mizell's Site

This is the content and code for smizell.com along with scripts around my writing process. I'm currently using Ruby to do some automation, so you'll need that if you want to run that (but why would you?). Also, I have an `.env` file for some environment config stuff, which you can use with `source .env`.

Check out `rake -T` to see the commands.
