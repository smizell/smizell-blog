      <p>
        The Language-Oriented Approach to API Development is a book about a different way to do API development.
        Instead of governing the way people in an organization use OpenAPI,
        the language-oriented approach encourages organizations to create DSLs tailored to the way they design APIs.

      <p>
        API by Design is a book about finding ways to measure
        complexity so we can design and build better APIs. Complexity is inevitable,
        so we need good ideas, approaches, and tools to help us deal with it we build
        and evolve APIs.
