Hi, I'm Stephen Mizell. I'm an API consultant with years of experience in the industry as a developer and product manager. 

* I worked at SmartBear as a Director of Product Management for API design on SwaggerHub
* I worked as an API engineer at Autodesk where I designed and built APIs along with helping define API standards
* I worked at Apiary as a senior software engineer and technical product manager working on API design tooling

I now work on my own as a consultant helping API tooling companies build great products. I also work on my own projects and writes about them here.
