Time is money. We save time. Spend time. Waste time. We invest our time into things we enjoy. We lose time as time runs out. This metaphor for time as money isn't about painting a picture of time. It defines the way we understand time. Time isn't *like* money. It *is* money.

George Lakoff and Mark Johnson make this case in [Metaphors We Live By](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34459.Metaphors_We_Live_By). They show how we understand our world through metaphors and how those metaphors drive our interactions.

Metaphors aren't reserved for the poets. They're all around us. For instance, good is up and bad is down. We 

## The organization as a machine

Gareth Morgan examines the relationship between metaphors and business in [Images of Organization](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/196016.Images_of_Organization). He defines eight different metaphors we use to describe organizations. The most common one used today is Organization as Machine.

Organizations that use the machine metaphor have inputs and outputs. They call people resources. Their planning is linear and their work happens like a factory line. People are cogs in the wheel. When things are great, people say it's running like a well-oiled machine. When they aren't, things are grinding to a halt.

Morgan says of organizations that use this metaphor:

> Organizational life is routinized with the precision demanded of clockwork. People are frequently expected to arrive at work at a given time, perform a predetermined set of activities, rest at appointed hours, then resume their tasks until work is over.

These types of organizations are organized into specializations and hierarchies where each area is measured by the outputs it produces. The metaphor of a machine drives the way the organization runs, organizes, and works. Like with Lakoff and Johnson's conclusion, the metaphor shapes the world we live in. And in this case, it shapes the places we work.

## How we communicate drives what we build

In 1967 Mel Conway wrote a paper called [How Do Committees Invent](https://www.melconway.com/Home/Conways_Law.html) where he proposed his thesis:

> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

People refer to this as Conway's Law. The idea is, the thing people build will have a design and structure that mirrors that of the organization that built it.

We see this in organizations that separate people into skillsets versus ones organized around business capabilities. An organization with a separate UI team, backend team, and database team will create a siloed architecture where each area is built and operated independently of the others. When teams are focused on business capabilities, they may be build and operate a system or product together. Martin Fowler and James Lewis discuss this in their [article on microservices](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html).

We use Conway's Law as a way to help us see the relationship between the people, the way they work, and the things they build. It can help us look for ways that bottlenecks and inefficiencies in a product can have direct relationships with bottlenecks and inefficiencies 

## Our metaphors shape our communications

We can put these ideas together to see how the metaphors we use for organizations have a direct impact on what we build. If our organizational metaphors determine the communication structure of an organization, and if that communication structure determines the design of the product we build, we can take away that the organizational metaphors influence our products.

It's not enough to reorganize companies around business capabilities, though. If people approach the organization as a machine, they'll continue this mindset even if the structure changes. We need to go beyond org charts to create change in the way we build. We need to change the lens through which we view the world, organizations, and the people that work in them. For this, we need better metaphors to build by.
