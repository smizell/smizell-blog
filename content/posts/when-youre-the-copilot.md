There's been a lot of chatter about GitHub's latest product [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/). People are unhappy that GitHub trained their proprietary models with open source software (OSS) and is now using those models to generate unattributed code. GitHub claims the copyright owner of the generated code is the new author, but since the code is derived from OSS, people argue it should include the license of the original code.

[This raises the question](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1410049195067674625) for me, is Copilot's AI creating derived work, or is it generating new code based on its understanding of all the work it has observed.

I have the same existential struggles as Copilot. I read a lot of code. I learn a lot for Stack Overflow and GitHub Issues. I've worked at places where I gained lots of industry insights during my time there. I've learned things from people directly and indirectly who are experts.

Am I creating derivative works? Am I doing the same as Copilot?

When I go to work, I don't come as a blank slate in which my employer can add what they like and claim ownership to whatever comes out of my mind. I don't create new ideas at work that have no other outside influence. When I work, I bring my entire self. And I not only bring my experiences and learnings. I give companies a portion of my brain space that extends far beyond my working hours. My brain is always working and jumping between ideas.

What part of that does the company own? I'm not trying to be greedy and say I own it all. I just don't see how an idea that grew from all those experiences and thoughts based decades of experiences that shaped my instincts could be owned by a company. Or owned by me. Everything I do is building upon other people's work. Should I be able to claim ownership of it?

I understand the legalities of the situation. In our society, companies own their software and the intellectual property (IP) around it which ensures they can make money from it without owing me any extra compensation. It's also ensures they take a lot of the risk of putting it out into the world. I get why it is the way it is. I'm sure I'd do the same if I were in their position.

I've been reading *Big Magic* by  Elizabeth Gilbert and she says this about ideas:

> I believe that our planet is inhabited not only by animals and plants and bacteria and viruses, but also by ideas. Ideas are a disembodied, energetic life-form. They are completely separate from us, but capable of interacting with us – albeit strangely. Ideas have no material body, but they do have consciousness, and they most certainly have will. Ideas are driven by a single impulse: to be made manifest. And the only way an idea can be made manifest in our world is through collaboration with a human partner. It is only through a human’s efforts that an idea can be escorted out of the ether and into the realm of the actual.

To Gilbert, ideas are thing. This is how lot of artists feel, that creativity is like discovering something more than making something from scratch. Michelangelo said:

> The sculpture is already complete within the marble block, before I start my work. It is already there, I just have to chisel away the superfluous material.

The challenging part of this is that we want to bottle up these intuitions and turn them into money. It's at the heart of why companies explicitly state in contracts that they claim ownership. And I think it's why people are concerned with Copilot. It doesn't feel fair that a company can take all the work and creativity and give it away to others without respecting the intentions of the author and their license.

OSS license holders can take the OSS software, learn from it, build upon it and change it, and use it to make their own money without owing anything to the original author. Most people are happy with this arrangement.

But it feels wrong when a large corporation leverages—some might say exploits—the ideals of the OSS community to train proprietary models that push the limits of computing and intuition. In Copilot's case, the output is close to the input—Copilot learns from code and then outputs code of its own. It's like GitHub broke the unwritten rules of OSS and maybe broke the written rules of the licenses.

So I understand the outrage around Copilot and feel some myself. But I also understand the struggles around the ownership of ideas and work. I want to work as myself without the constant threat of a company from my past suing me for using their IP. I want to own my experiences and be able to take my ideas with me as I move through life. And I acknowledge any of my ideas exist because of someone else's ideas and someone else's collaboration. Copilot faces the same dilemma.

Should we be OK when computers start doing something we've reserved for humans? Should we view tools like Copilot as augmenting the human experience or as having an experience all to its own? Should I be afraid that I'm empathizing with AI? It will be interesting to see how this situation shapes the coming concerns as AI improves.
