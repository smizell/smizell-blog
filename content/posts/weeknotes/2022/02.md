* I've started taking a pottery class. It's a much-welcomed escape from my digital working life that I don't normally take. I read and write, but I don't do much with my hands like this.
* I recently discovered Pandoc as a great tool for building [nice-looking PDFs](https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template) from Markdown.
* [Murderville](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15264192/) was ridiculous.
* I'm reading *â€ŒHow to Be Perfect: The Correct Answer to Every Moral Question* by Michael Schur. I'm also trying to finish *Dune*.
* I'm on a 28-day win streak in Wordle, but I haven't let it go to my head.
