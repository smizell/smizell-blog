I started my long vacation this Wednesday. I'm off until August 2nd and could not be happier. It's a strange feeling taking time off when you're self-employed. There are no vacation days. The income goes to zero. You see how much time-off costs you. But it's worth it.

I haven't done much with my time other than clean and play a 6am round of golf. I've tried to stay away from the computer as much as I could. That's been a nice break. I was feeling the need to take time off a month ago, and I'm using it to rest and recharge. Normally, I let that feeling go too long.

## Notes

* Friday my family had a Skyward Sword party. We ordered pizzas and ate dessert. We're so much of a Zelda family that we have a triforce sticker on the back of our van. It's a big deal for us to start a new game.
* I started listening to [Bird to Bird](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12543.Bird_by_Bird) by Anne Lamott.
* I started listening to [Mindset](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40745.Mindset) by Carol S. Decker.
* We finished S1 of [Loki](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9140554/). I'm starting to lose interest in these Marvel shows. At first, they're hard for me to get into. Then they get interesting in the middle. Then they end with a meh.
* I watched a Netflix documentary called [The Most Unknown](https://www.netflix.com/title/80222042).
* I'm reading [Big Magic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24453082-big-magic) by Elizabeth Gilbert.
* I have a hard time sticking with note-taking tools and practices. My pattern is, I find an interesting approach like Bullet Journaling, buy a pristine, fancy notebook, use it for a month, then forget about it. I came across this writeup about [Paper Notes](https://macwright.com/2019/01/02/paper-notes.html) and decided to give my unused [Field Note](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/) memo books a try. Weirdly, it's working.
