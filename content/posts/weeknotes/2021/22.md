This week I opened up preordering for my book [_API by Design_](https://smizell.gumroad.com/l/apibydesign). This has dominated my time outside my normal working hours.

I've had a lot of fun writing it. It's been enjoyable taking ideas I'd been working on for a long time and trying to package them up to share with others. This takes a lot of time and work. And help from others.

I've enjoyed this ebook format for writing. It's not as long as a normal technical book, but it's also a lot longer than a blog post. It's almost like 15-20 blog posts that you have to fit together in a cohesive way. I wanted the book to be short and dense where each section shared a single idea. I hope I was able to get close on that.

## Aeropress

The only other new thing is that we got an Aeropress. I started using a French Press a couple of months ago but didn't enjoy the cleanup process of it. I came across the Aeropress and decided to give it a shot. This thing makes some really good coffee. And the cleanup is quick. We bought an electric water kettle a while back, so we can now make a good cup of coffee in a few minutes now. I think it's a good balance in making a cup of coffee, cleanup process, and time spent making it.
