It's already October? This part of the year always flies by for me. It's so busy with holidays and birthday. I do love Fall weather, though, which we're starting to get a glimpse of now.

I didn't write a weeknote for last week. I was too busy! First, I released my book [_API by Design_](http://apibydesign.com). I've been researching the topic for several months and writing the content for a couple of them. Writing a book is a lot of work, even a shorter one like this. There are so many more things I wish I had the time for but didn't.

Second, I gave a presentation at the API Specification Conference. I gave my talk from the content on [this site](https://asc2021.smizell.com/). The content is about 50% from the book and 50% new. The recording should be out soon. Speaking to an audience you can see or hear is challenging. I made the mistake of reading the chat while I was talking. It made me lose my thoughts and stumble over my words. But it was a good experience otherwise, and I'm happy to have had the opportunity.

## Updated site design

I picked [a Hugo theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) when I started things over on this site so I could get up and writing quickly. It was nice, but I had grown tired of it. It was also not easy to customize.

I ripped everything out of the theme I could to get down to the bare bonesâ€”it's just black text on a white background for now. I have some ideas for what I want to do with it, but I don't feel in a rush to work on them.

## Using Grammarly

I upgraded to the premium version of Grammarly and was impressed with how much it improved my writing. I turned it on while finishing my book at it showed me 500+ places for improvement. Most of them were ways to make the writing clearer or remove unnecessary words. I'll definitely keep using.

## Notes

- I had the opportunity to [chat with Erik Wilde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuzhjxJv1jo) on his Youtube channel about the book.
- We finished Skyward Sword as a family. It's such a long game, but it's great. The kids really enjoyed it.
- We finished watching _The Dragon Prince_ as a family. We all enjoyed it.
- I finished [_Pretend It's a City_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13660958/).
