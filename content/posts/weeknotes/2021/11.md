We took a mini vacation with another family this week. Our friends rented a cabin on a lake with a pool. We spent all our time swimming, canoeing, and lounging around. I love vacations like that. You get a chance to unplug mentally from it all and do nothing or whatever you want.

After our trip, we took the kids to see [Garden of the Gods](https://www.shawneeforest.com/garden-of-the-gods/) for their first time. It's a beautiful place. We checked it out and left for the [Cave in Rock Ferry](https://www.facebook.com/CIRFerry/). We didn't tell the kids what we were doing. It was fun to sit on the shore of the river with no bridge as they tried to figure out how we were going to cross.

It's Independence Day here in the US. We'll be heading to watch fireworks tonight that our city puts on.
