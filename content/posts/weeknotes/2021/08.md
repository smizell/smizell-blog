My experiment of starting over on this site is working. If I counted correctly, this is my 11th post here. I've written in a few weeks what took me several years before.

I haven't stopped tinkering with the site, though, but it's a different tinkering. I started out [publishing with make](/posts/2021/06/publishing-with-make/), but decided to switch to Rake because I can.

I added a couple new [tasks](https://github.com/smizell/smizell-blog/blob/main/Rakefile), one for writing posts and one for creating new weeknotes. For instance, to start writing this weeknote, I ran `rake weeknotes:new`. It figured out what file to create, used the `weeknotes` [archetype](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/), and opened iA Writer. When I'm done writing, I'll run `rake publish`, and it will stage the new content, commit it, and push to GitHub, where Netlify will take over.

If I keep up this cadence, I'm going to write a tool that schedules posts. But that hasn't been a problem yet so I'm going to resist with all my might to do it.

## Notes

* My back started hurting again this week. It loosened up for my golf trip, but then went back to normal afterwards. This is going to be my excuse for buying [a fancy new chair](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/cosm-chairs/).
* I submitted a talk to the [API Spec Conference](apispecs.io) on the topic of [schema entropy](/tags/schema-entropy/).
* I listened to an interesting interview with [Tina Fey](https://www.smartless.com/episodes/episode/2abb980c/tina-fey). We watched her in 30 Rock sometime last year and enjoyed it.
* I was a week late on returning two books to the library. For shame.
* I [wrote an intro](/posts/2021/06/intro-to-api-design-systems/) about a project of mine called [API Design Systems](https://apidesign.systems/).
* Among the many time sinks in my life, I've been reading about van life where you convert vans into livable campers.
