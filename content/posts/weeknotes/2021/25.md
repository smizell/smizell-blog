- Our youngest kid had a birthday. It was a week full of unicorns, pizza, and cake.
- I created a [landing page](https://apibydesign.com/) for my book. However, I think I'm going to move it away from the dedicated domain to this one.
- I've been reading *This is Marketing* by Seth Godin. I enjoy the way he writes.
- I've been tinkering with [an idea](/posts/2021/10/what-if/).
- I'm thinking of adding a [notes section](https://indieweb.org/note) on this site for shorter writing.
