I'm writing this again using GitHub Codespaces.
I got Hugo working to be able to serve up the local server by setting up port forwarding for port 1313.
[Port forwarding](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace) is a feature in Codespaces, so it's just a few clicks.
Then I provided Hugo with the URL Codespaces created and told it to not append the port.
It works, but LiveReload doesn't because of some protocol issues.
I'll dig more into that later.

```sh
hugo server -D --baseUrl <forwarded-url> --appendPort=false
```

It's fancy.
The keyboard shortcuts aren't that great since it's in the browser and they conflict sometimes.
But overall it still feels like the future.
Being able to do all of this from a Chromebook is neat experience.

After finishing writing my [book](https://apibydesign.com), I haven't been writing much.
I have lots of ideas swirling around, but I haven't had interest in sitting down to write.
I haven't even written a weeknote in a few weeks either.

## Notes

- We watched _Only Murders in the Building_. We loved it. I highly recommend it.
- I read [_The Agile Comms Handbook_](https://agilecommshandbook.com/). If I get the motivation, I'll write some about it.
- I'm reading _Several short sentences about writing_. It's been a good read.
- I'm taking off some extended time in December and can't wait for it to get here.
