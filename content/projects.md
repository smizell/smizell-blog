* [API by Design](https://apibydesign.com) - a book I wrote and self-published on understanding how complexity affects our API designs and design processes.
* [API Design Systems](https://apidesign.systems) - a project around describing API standards and guidelines for a company in a machine-readable format.
* [RESTful JSON](https://restfuljson.org) - a pattern and media type for including hyperlinks in APIs. It's a way to help people add hypermedia into their APIs without giving up all their existing tools and practices.
* [API Elements](https://apielements.org/en/latest/) - a project I led while at Apiary that provided the foundation for parsing multiple API description formats like OpenAPI and API Blueprint into a centralized format.
* [Refract](https://github.com/refractproject/refract-spec) - the foundational work for API Elements, which was a personal project of mine. It's also used by SmartBear on their [SwaggerHub parser](https://github.com/swagger-api/apidom).
* [API Dev Portal Example](https://github.com/smizell/api-dev-portal) - I put this together as an example for using Next.js to create developer portals. There's [a running example](https://apidevportal.smizell.com/) as well.
