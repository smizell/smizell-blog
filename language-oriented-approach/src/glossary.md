# Glossary

**AGM**: See API Governance Model

**API Design**: The act of designing the specific details of how an API will work, including the technologies, standards, and vocabulary used in the API.

**API Development Lifecycle**: The process for API development that includes designing, implementing, testing, building, deploying, and monitoring APIs.

**API Program**: An initiative at an organization that tries to define how the organization will collective build and maintain APIs.

**API Governance Model (AGM)**: A model defined by an organization that defines how it will apply governance to their APIs based on their agreed-upon styles and standards.

**Backend for a Frontend (BFF)**: Commonly refers to an API that provides the backend for a specific UI. Organizations that use BFFs may have different APIs for their web, mobile, and desktop applications.

**Code-First**: An approach to API development that generates the API design reference from the implementation. This commonly stands in contrast to Design-First.

**Code Generation**: In the context of API development, code generation refers to the process of generating client and server code from API designs.

**Conversational Language**: The language—including terms, concepts, standards, principles, and practices—an organization uses to design and develop APIs.

**Design-First**: An approach to API development that encourages people to consider the design of the API before working its implementation. This commonly stands in contrast to Code-First.

**Domain-Specific Language (DSL)**: A language that is used for describing a specific domain. This stands in contrast to general-purpose programming languages.

**General-Purpose Format**: An API design format meant for a broader use and for many different kinds of API designs. OpenAPI is an example of a general-purpose format.

**Format-Oriented Approach**: An approach to API development that orients the API development lifecycle around general-purpose formats and uses tooling to ensure the API design matches the organization's Conversational Language. This stands in contrast to the Language-Oriented Approach.

**Language-Oriented Approach**: An approach to API development that orients the API development lifecycle around the language the organization uses to design APIs. This stands in contrast to the Format-Oriented Approach.

**Microservice Architecture**: An approach to building systems that encourages organizations to build small, single-purpose, self-contained services rather than monolithic applications.

**OpenAPI**: A general-purpose API description language for describing APIs.

**Tailored DSL**: A DSL tailored to the needs and Conversational Language of an organization.

**Tooling**: Software, either built or purchased.
