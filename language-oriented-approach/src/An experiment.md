Twitter has gotten weird for me lately. Part of the reason is that a lot of people I follow have either left or stopped publishing. Another reason is that for some people that I thought weren't posting actually were—I just missed their content because of the way the timeline now works.

With the changes that Elon Musk is making, I feel less interested in engaging with the platform. As I feel the draw from those in the fediverse, I see an opportunity to question and rethink my approach to writing and publishing online. I initially thought that I'd prefer to be done.

I started writing online around a decade ago. I had gotten into APIs at my day job and had dug into some ideas that changed the way I looked at software. It was a fun time for me! I started (or maybe restarted) a blog and got a new Twitter handle because my previous one was mostly a silly stuff. I wanted to be professional with a pristine account. 

This move fragmented myself. I was more academic and reserved when I published online, and when I wrote, I made sure it was as polished as I could make it. Some periods of that time were full of writing and sharing, but the bulk of the time was filled with silence. I watched from the edges.

I've found I want to put less of myself online—I even question if I want to publish this! And I'm not interested in moving over to Mastodon to get away from the Twitter nonsense. I just want to leave it all behind and somehow keep the ability to listen and learn from interesting people. I get that people are excited about the fediverse, but it doesn't excite me.

## Writing online

There are some people I follow that are authentic, but on average the feeling I get from people is that they are primarily building a brand of themselves. I don't discredit this. They are working hard and creating a good life for themselves. But it's not for me.

I publish online when I get excited about something, when an idea just won't go away and when I have the feeling that I must share it. I broadcast those things that interest me in hopes of finding others who love the dance with ideas. While 80% of the feedback I get online is critical, telling me what will and won't work, the other 20% is from people wanting to engage with ideas in a different way, a way where they put aside their own ideas and preconceptions and try to listen, observe, play, rethink, and question. In those interactions with people, I get to put my own idea aside and see something new emerge from the interaction.
